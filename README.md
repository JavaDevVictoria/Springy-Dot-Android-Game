Springy-Dot-Android-Game
========================

Between late February and early April 2014 I was enrolled in an online course at Future Learn to learn how to develop an Android app using Java.  This simple game is my output from the course. I learnt a lot in the 7 weeks of the course but the game is still very much a work in progress - I have numerous enhancements planned for the coming months.  I welcome any suggestions on how the game can be improved - please keep it constructive though.

How to install the game on your device
=======================================

This game will soon be made available on the Google Play Store, but for now, you can sideload the APK file onto your Android device.  To do this, you'll need to go to Settings -> Security and check the "Unknown Sources" checkbox (if it's not already checked).  This will enable you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.  Then on your PC, visit <a href="https://github.com/JavaDevVictoria/Springy-Dot-Android-Game/blob/master/SpringyDot.apk?raw=true">this link</a> to download the APK file.  You can then email it to your Android device or transfer it via USB.  On your device, open the file, and if the "Complete action using..." dialog box appears, select "Package installer" and follow the on-screen instructions.  Once installed, you'll be ready to play the game. 

Playing the game
=================

The object of the game is to tilt your phone to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen so that the purple ball bounces off it and hits the large yellow smiley ball near the top of the screen.  If you successfully hit the smiley ball, you win a point.  When you reach certain point thresholds (I'll keep the exact number as a surprise) the background image will change - this is a rudimentary levels system.  If you hit the sad ball, you will lose a point.  And if the purple ball misses the paddle and hits the bottom of the screen, it's game over for you!

Enjoy!
